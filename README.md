# m-ld-io-js-build

_Base build library for m-ld.io Javascript projects_

Shell scripts & other materials for common build patterns. Intended to be referenced as a dev dependency, i.e.

```
  "devDependencies": {
    "@m-ld/io-js-build": "^0.1.0",
    ...
```

Doing so makes the scripts in the /bin folder available to npx, e.g. `npx publish.sh prerelease`.
